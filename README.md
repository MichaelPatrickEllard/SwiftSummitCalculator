This is a sample code project for Swift Summit San Francisco 2015

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of Swift type aliases and extensions to create a cross-platform app.  

The foundation for this project comes from the XKitCalculator and XCatalog projects that Michael Patrick Ellard and Mike Mehr created for iOSDevCamp2015. Those projects won the iOSDevCamp2015 "Best Developer Tool" award.  

This new sample code project has unique features and new code that was not present in the previous projects, and it takes a different approach in many areas than the previous projects did. 

This code lives at https://github.com/MichaelPatrickEllard/SwiftSummitCalculator
